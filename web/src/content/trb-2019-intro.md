The Russian Bats 2019 Edition
=============================

Well, here we are. Like clockwork, baseball season is upon us! Like always, there is going to be some change from year to year. We are trying something new this year, we have a website! https://therussianbats.com I'm super excited to see what we can do with it. Please hit me up with suggestions for content!

Draft Date and Time: The draft is tentatively scheduled for **Sunday March 24th at 8PM**. Please let me know if anyone has issues with this date and/or time.
Keeper selection deadline: Keepers must be submitted to the office of the commissioner (send me an email with the subject `2019 Keepers`) by **Friday March 22nd**.

For everyone's sanity, I've put together a Keeper spreadsheet here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1POPv398-Hw7wRDknGGeYUpjFOhuIyGJua9sWRxBLY7k/edit?usp=sharing All teams from 2018 are in the spreadsheet with their end of year rosters. Use the spreadsheet to pick your keepers using the 'Keepable' and 'Draft Cost This Year' columns!

I'd like to hear from the league about what communication methods are best for everyone. Its 2019, and email is not everyone's favorite. Discord maybe?

Last year I heard a lot of displeasure from managers about our move from daily to weekly lineups. That has been heard, and lineups are now daily again!

Keepers are another area that has been given a facelift. Last year was the first year we played with keepers, and there was a lot to learn. The new rules hopefully refine the keeper system and balance short and long term roster makeups.

Scoring for pitchers got a bit of an overhaul. The reasons include the changing nature of pitchers in the MLB and weirdness of pitcher stats. Moving two roster spots from SP to P should help managers get more creative with which pitcher you roster. Adding Quality Starts while keeping Wins should balance the desire for classic stats (and the wild variability that comes with it) with the more pitcher focused QS stat.

With that all being said, I look forward to what should be another great edition of the league this year. I wish everyone the best luck (except Josh). Have fun out there!

Changes for 2019
----------------

Here are the full set of changes for the 2019 season!

### Lineup Changes
+ We are back to Daily lineups (yes, the grass is indeed greener).
+ Add/drops now go into effect day-of instead of tomorrow.

### Roster Changes

+ The number of DL spots has been reduced from 3 to 1.
  + Should make more players available
  + Should curb camping on DL players
+ Pitching positions have changed:
  + From 4 SP, 2 RP, 0 P
  + To 2 SP, 2 RP, 2 P
  + Should help in finding options for pitchers, especially with real baseball moving to higher bullpen usage.

### Scoring Changes:
A few minor tweaks to the scoring have been made. I've split the changes between hitters and pitchers.

Pitching:
+ Quality Starts has been introduced!
  + A Quality Start is when a starting pitcher goes 6 innings with 3 or less runs allowed.
  + Quality Starts are worth 2 points
+ Wins have been reduced from 5 to 2 points.
+ Losses have been changed from -4 points to -2.
+ Runs has replaced Earned Runs, but the points remain the same (-2).
+ Saves and Holds have been combined into one stat (SV+HLD) and one of those is worth 5 points.

Astute readers may have noticed that a QS and a W are worth the same. This should allow some flexibility regarding good pitchers on bad teams and bad pitchers on good teams. Good pitchers on good teams are still the best, but now there should be more options out there to find points.

Hitting:
+ Stolen Bases and Caught Stealing have been combined into one stat, Net Stolen Bases (NSB).
  + NSB grants +1 for a SB and -1 for a CS. That should keep the clutter out of the player stat pages.
+ Hit by Pitch has been added to hitters and is worth 1 point.
+ Errors have been removed (they were -1 points before).

Nothing major for Hitters.

### Keepers:
See [this page](/keepers) for all the new rules, but let me break down the essentials.

Two rules have been added to increase player turnover from year to year -
+ Keepers now increase in cost year to year
+ Players drafted or kept using a top 3 round draft pick are now non-keepable

A new rule for keeping undrafted players has been added:
+ Undrafted players now cost the average between their current projected draft round and the last round of the draft

Please checkout the [keepers](/keepers) page for all the detail.
