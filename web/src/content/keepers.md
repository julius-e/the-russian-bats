This league is a [keeper league](https://baseball.fantasysports.yahoo.com/b1/2764/keeperintro).

Every year you allowed to carry over _some_ of your players. There are rules governing which players are eligible to be kept each year. The rules are as follows:

### Players must be in yahoo's list of players.
Self explanatory: to keep a player, they must exist in the yahoo system. **The list of players is the responsibility of Yahoo, the commissioner has no control of if/when players are added**

### You may keep up to 3 players
You don't have to keep any players, but you can keep up to 3.

### Keeping players costs draft picks
The cost to keep a player is equal to the draft cost from the previous season, minus 3 rounds. Each year a player is kept increases that player's cost.

__Example:__
Team A drafts Luis Severino in the 10th round in 2018. If Team A wants to keep Severino in 2019, they must give up their 7th round pick to do so.

### Players may only be on a team for 3 consecutive seasons.
Adds some balance over the long term.

**NOTE:** please do not confuse "on a team for 3 consecutive seasons" with "kept for 3 seasons". You draft a player **once**, and can keep them **twice** (3 total years).

### Players that change teams mid season **retain their old team's service time**.
That means trades and waivers do not reset the 3 year clock. The only thing that resets the 3 year rule is the player entering the draft (i.e. the player's not kept) at the start of the year.

### Players drafted or kept in the first three rounds the previous season are not elligible to be kept
This rule keeps high-level players changing hands year to year.

### Keeping two players from the same round
It is possible to trade for a player that happens to have the same round value as another player that already was on your team. If this happens, you may keep both, but the second player costs your next most valueable pick.

Example 1:
* Player A and Player B were both drafted in the 10th round in 2018.
* You had Player A on your roster originally, and you traded for Player B mid season.
* You now want to keep both players.
* The cost will be a **10th rounder** for Player A and a **9th rounder** for player B

Example 2:
* Player A and Player B were both drafted in the 10th round in 2018. Player C was drafted in the 9th round.
* You had Player A and Player C were on your roster originally, and you traded for Player B mid season.
* You now want to keep all three players.
* The cost will be a **10th rounder** for Player A and a **9th rounder** for Player C, and a **8th rounder** for Player B

### Keeping undrafted players
You may keep undrafted (as in were not kept and were not selected in the draft) players. The cost is the average between the current year's estimated draft round (also called ADP) and the last round (currently 21st round).

Example:
* Player A was not drafted in 2018
* Player A was picked up mid season by your team
* On average, Player A is currently being drafted in the 5th round in H2H Points leagues in 2019
* Keeping Player A will cost a 13th round pick this year (`(5 + 21)/2`)
